  <strong>Betsy Grover and Dom Savaiano recently won a not-guilty verdict after a nearly two-week trial in Cook County, Illinois.</strong>  <br />

Plaintiff is a female Vietnam veteran, having served in the Army and the Marines for 8 years.  She currently works for the VA Hospital.   Plaintiff asked the jury for at least $750,000.  The jury promptly returned a verdict in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff.  Among the significant moments of the trial was the cross examination of Plaintiff’s expert, a well-credentialed orthopedic surgeon, who was led to describe findings on an x-ray that did not actually exist and who was impeached more than a dozen times during the cross examination.
  <br /><br />

  <strong>Frank DeBoni & Jack Murphy successfully defended a punitive damages claim brought against a world renowned 5 Star Luxury Hotel in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. </strong> <br />

  <strong>Paul Bozych and Jack Murphy obtained a favorable court decision on a dispositive motion</strong>
  <br />
  Paul Bozych and Jack Murphy recently obtained a favorable court decision on a dispositive motion in the Northern District of Illinois regarding personal jurisdiction.  Plaintiff, an Illinois attorney, originally brought a defamation claim in Illinois state court seeking damages arising from an internet posting by a not for profit entity that questioned the veracity of statements made by plaintiff while arguing a case before the Supreme Court of Indiana.  The matter was removed to the Northern District of Illinois where dismissal was sought on jurisdictional grounds.  In his attempt to establish jurisdiction, plaintiff made technical arguments regarding meta-tags, meta-data, interactivity and content found on the not for profit’s website.  The defense was required to perform a detailed analysis of the website source code to show that its reference to the forum was minimal and could not confer jurisdiction.  This case provides a useful jurisdictional analysis in the cyber context.

   <br />
  On May 30, 2013, Jeff Zehe won a defense verdict after a two-week jury trial in the Federal District Court of Connecticut.  The plaintiff sought a seven-figure damage amount for violation of his constitutional rights alleging that a New Haven police detective framed him for a murder charge by threatening and coaching witnesses who identified the plaintiff.
  <br /><br />
  In the criminal case, those same witnesses failed to testify and later recanted their identification.  In the civil trial, each of those witnesses accused the detective of coercing them, supporting the plaintiff’s theory.  Even though the plaintiff spent 11 months in jail before the criminal case was dismissed, the jury was convinced the officer had probable cause for the plaintiff’s arrest and rejected the plaintiff’s claim.

        <strong>Hess wins in the Court of Appeals of Georgia. </strong><br />
        In a subrogation action arising from damage to personal property suffered by
        a holdover tenant in Georgia.  The trial court awarded summary judgment to the landlord based on a waiver of subrogation in
        the expired lease.  Partner Patrick Hess appealed that ruling and obtained a reversal.  The Court of Appeals of Georgia ruled
        that the waiver of subrogation did not continue to apply after the expired lease because it was not a term, like rent, that
        was necessary for the landlord/tenant relationship to continue.
